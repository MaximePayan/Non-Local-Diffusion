# Non-Local-Diffusion
Script and proofs for the article Computer-assisted proof for nonlocal reaction diffusion equations, Bao, Breden, Payan, Reish, 2025

The proof of the main result is in two parts:
- lucnh analysis_wrt_delta.m **with Intlab** -> Fig 4ab, proof of Theorem 2.2
- lunch first_eigv_analysis **with Intlab** -> Fig 5 and Fig 6, proof of Proposition 3.4
  
Optional:
- lunch radii_analysis.m with N = 5, p = 1.7, delta = 1 or 4, **lunch it without Intlab** to get Fig 2 and Fig 3.

The figures are already loaded.
